## Getting Started

    Before you proceed ensure that [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) is installed and then install the WebAssembly target via the terminal: 

    ```bash
    $ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
    ```
    Next, install Trunk, a purely rust based bunlder to build our project:

    ```bash
    $ cargo install --locked trunk
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli
    ```
